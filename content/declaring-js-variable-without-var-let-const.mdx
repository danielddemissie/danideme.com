## Why we need to use var, or let and const to declare variable in javaScipt?

![let-const-var](https://danideme-com.vercel.app/images/posts/declaring-js-variable-without-var-let-const.jpeg)

The short explanation for this is to **not messup the global object** both in browser and nodejs/backend enviroment. 
In browser the global object is the `window` object while in node the the global object is `global` object. 

To further explain this in JavaScript, there's always a global object defined in a web browser, when scripts create global variables defined with the `var` keyword, they're created as members of the global object. 
(In Node.js this is not the case.) The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running. 

For example:
    - In a web browser, any code which the script doesn't specifically start up as a background task has a `Window` as its global object. This is the vast majority of JavaScript code on the Web.
    - Code running in a Worker has a `WorkerGlobalScope` object as its global object.
    - Scripts running under `Node.js` have an object called `global` as their global object.
