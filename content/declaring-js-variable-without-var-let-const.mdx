title:  "Why we need to declare variable with var, let or const?"

publishedAt:  "2024-06-25"

summary:  "In JavaScript we can declare variables either by using one of these keyword `var, let or const`, or simply without any of them. A variable declared this way have the same behavior as a variable declared with the `var` keyword (more on this in the post)."

**What are undeclared variables in JavaScript and why we don't use them that often?**

  

*Undeclared variable* is a variable that is not declare using one of the keywords var, let or const to create.

  

Syntax:

```js

/** In JavaScript we normally declare and assign a value to our variables like */

var num =  10;

/** when we are doing this we are actualy doing var num; first and

then num=10 on excution, in javaScript this is handled by the concept

called `hoisting`.*/

  

/*We can also create a variable without `var, let or const` keywords like*/

undeclaredVaribale="value"

```

In JavaScript `undeclared variable` does not exist until we assign them a value (They are not hoisted unlike a declared variables), Therefor assigning a value to `an undeclared variable` implicitly creates it as a global variable
when the assignment is executed. `This means all undeclared variables are global variables`. (This is also highly likely to mess up the global objects at both browser and back-end environment.)

To demonstrate this behavior, let's have a look at this example:

```js

function  example(){

    isGlobal =  true

    let isLocal =  true

}

  

example() 
/** 
 * now that we have executed the example function JavaScript 
 * will create the `isGlobal` variable as a Global variable. Let's check this 
 * */

  
console.log(isGlobal)

/**

* Output: true

*/

  

console.log(isLocal)

/**

* Output: ReferenceError: isLocal is not defined

* Reason: this is a totaly expected behavior b/c a declared variable will be first hoisted at either function scope or global scope before function

* excution, more on this later.

*/

  

```

  

Now that we understand how JavaScript handle undeclared variables, it's always recommended to use a declared variable in a function or global scope. Let's move to understand in depth about declared variables.

  

#### [var](#var)

  

<a  id="var"></a>

Before `ES6` var was the only keyword available to create a variable, The scope of a variable declared with this keyword is its current execution context.
This is either the enclosing function or for variables declared outside any function, global. Example :

  

```js

// Global Scope:
  
  
console.log(varExample)

/* Output: undefined, the varaibale is hoisted to the top before excution

therefore it dosen't throw RefrenceError and in javaScript variable declared with

var will be initialized with undefined as value(This is not the case for let and const)

*/

var varExample =  "value"


// Funciton Scope:
  

function  example(){

    console.log(isLocal)

    var isLocal =  true;

    

    if (isLocal){

        var funScoped =  true

    }

    

    console.log(funScoped) //Output: true, why?

}

  

example()

/**

* Output: undefined,

* That's right, the variable is hoisted to top of the

* function scope before excution. This kind of behaviour makes it

* hard to debug so it's always recommended to declare and intialize

* our variables at the top of the context before using.

*/

```

  

#### [let](#let)

  

<a  id="let"></a>

  

The major upgrade from the var in `ES6's let` is it's `block scoped` not function scoped, what does this means? it means the variable's
scope is bound to the block it was declared not the function it was declared. Example? Sure:

  

```js
//Block scope:

  
console.log(name)

let name =  "daniel"

  

/**

* Output: RefrenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initalizing

*

* This is b/c javaScript will hoist variables declared with both

* const and let but they will remain uninitialized.

*/

  

function  example(){

    // let use the above exmaple

    let isLocal =  true;

    

    if (isLocal) {

    // A variable declared with let or const, will have block scope context i.e the context in this condition

    // is bound to this condition/block only not to the funtion.

    let funScoped =  false;

    }

    

    console.log(funScoped)

    /**

    * Output: RefrenceError: funScope is not defined

    * This is a very useful upgrade from var

    */

}

```

  

#### [const](#const)

  

<a  id="const"></a>

  

The const keyword is used to create `immutable variable` means variables whose value can not be reassigned or modified. Just like the let
variable created with const are bound to the top block level context when hoisted. The most noticeable differences with let are

- const doesn't allow you to reassigned a variable.

- const can't be declared with out initializing.

  

One final example:

  

```js

const NAME;

console.log(NAME) //Output: SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

NAME =  "daniel"

  

const X =  'x'

X='y'  //Ouput: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

```
